        <p>A web developer makes and maintains websites. They are in charge of a site’s overall look and feel. Web developers also
        handle the technical aspects of a website, including its performance (website speed) and capacity (the maximum amount of
        traffic the site could handle at a given time). A web developer is usually knowledgeable in both graphic design and
        programming.</p>
